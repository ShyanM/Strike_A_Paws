## 1. UX

The main aim for this website is to provide a platform for Regina to showcase her work and provide a place where potential customers can find all the information they might need including how to book a photoshoot of their pets.

Customer's goals are:

### Business Owner Goals

### Developer Goals

### User Stories

As a customer I want:

- to be able to see various photos so that I know how mine can turn out.
- to be able to navigate with ease through pages.
- to see the prices so I can see if the service is affordable.
- an easy way to contact the photographer.

### Design Choices

* Colour Scheme

![alt text](./wireframes/colourscheme.png)

I chose this colour scheme because I wanted the photos to be the main attraction and this soft colour scheme helps with that. 
The seashell colour was used for the background of all pages as well as the white colour of text.
The dark liver colour was used instead of a black, so that the font was a little softer and fit in with the theme. It was also used as a shadow because it provided a softer shadow than black.
All three colours were used to highlight important parts and to bring all pages together with the colour scheme.

* Images

The images used were all sourced from Pexels.com. Since it's a photography website the images were what made the website. That's why I chose the most outstanding photos for the hero images as well as the gallery.


### Wireframes

- [Home](./wireframes/home.png)
- [Gallery](./wireframes/gallery.png)
- [Services](./wireframes/services.png)
- [Contact](./wireframes/contact.png)

while the initial plan for the website was to have only a hero image in the landing page, it was decided to create a hero image for each page, to show off more of Regina's photography as well as to keep all pages consistent.
