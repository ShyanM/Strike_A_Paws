## 1. UX

### Project Goals

The main aim for this website is to provide a platform for Regina to showcase her work and provide a place where potential customers can find all the information they might need including how to book a photoshoot of their pets.

### Customer Goals

The target audience for this project are pet owners.

Customer's goals are:

- to see Regina's portfolio.
- to see other customer's reviews.
- to contact Regina for a consultation or photoshoot.
- to see the services offered.
- to learn more about the photographer.


### Business Owner Goals

- to showcase her work in an elegant way.
- to drum up new business.
- to have a site to point potential customers to.
- increase photoshoot bookings.

### Developer Goals

- To create a beautiful, elegant website that provides great user experience for customers.
- to have a responsive website that works well on various mediums.

### User Stories

As a customer I want:

- to be able to see various photos so that I know how mine can turn out.
- to be able to navigate with ease through pages.
- to see the prices so I can see if the service is affordable.
- an easy way to contact the photographer.
- to see other people's experiences and reviews.

### Design Choices

* Colour Scheme

![alt text](./wireframes/colourscheme.png)

I chose this colour scheme because I wanted the photos to be the main attraction and this soft colour scheme helps with that. 
The seashell colour was used for the background of all pages as well as the white colour of text.
The dark liver colour was used instead of a black, so that the font was a little softer and fit in with the theme. It was also used as a shadow because it provided a softer shadow than black.
All three colours were used to highlight important parts and to bring all pages together with the colour scheme.

* Images

The images used were all sourced from Pexels.com. Since it's a photography website the images were what made the website. That's why I chose the most outstanding photos for the hero images as well as the gallery.


### Wireframes

- [Home](./wireframes/home.png)
- [Gallery](./wireframes/gallery.png)
- [Services](./wireframes/services.png)
- [Contact](./wireframes/contact.png)

while the initial plan for the website was to have only a hero image in the landing page, it was decided to create a hero image for each page, to show off more of Regina's photography as well as to keep all pages consistent.


## 2. Features

The website has 4 pages that users can reach easily. It also has a fifth page that only shows up once people submit their details in the contact page.

* General Features

    * Navigation 

        This allows the user to navigate through different pages.

    * Paw Icon

        This gives the user an easy access to the home page without having to use the navigation bar.


* Home page
    
    * About me section
        
        This section welcomes the user to the page and introduces them to Regina.

    * Reviews

        This section allows the readers to see other people's experience.

* Gallery page

     This page shows a portfolio of Regina's work and has a small zoom in effect to make the page more dynamic.


* Services page

    This allows the user to see the packages on offer. It also has a button for the customer to enquire which takes the customer to the contact page.

* Contact page

    This allows customers to get in contact with Regina. Once the details are added and a submit button is used, the page takes the customer to a new page with a thank you message.

* Features to implement in the future

    The selling of Regina's prints with a click of a button.

    The ability to click and submit an enquiry based on the particular service the customer chose.

    With the use of javascript, which I currently don't know, I would be able to get rid of the thank you page and use a modal that provides a pop up thank you on the same page.
